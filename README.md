# LifeStream 
This repo holds the backend for the personal project to handle life events such as habits, finances and activities using 
Designing Data-Intensive Applications book by Martin Kleppmann as a guide to build something where I can apply this theory.

By the moment, I will work with my **personal habits** to be tracked using this service.

## Dependencies

I'm using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the dependencies in this project.
